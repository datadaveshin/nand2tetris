# nand2tetris
I'm going through the Nand2Tetris course to get a better understanding of how the computer works. As a child, I had an electronics set, it was my favorite toy. In it you could build NOT, OR, AND, NAND and XOR gates if I remember correctly. 

In this course, we are provided with a hardware simulator, and start with a given NAND gate and work our way through the abstracted computer heirarchy. Going from basic gates like those listed above, to multiplexors/demultiplexors then multi-bit and multi-way versions. From there, Adders and an incrementer are built, then an ALU, registers and RAM (via another given Digital Flip-Flop gate, to a CPU called Hack. On the software side, we will go through machine language, assembly, and then build a higher level language called Jack.

I'm doing this for fun and personal education along with my coding/mathematician buddies [Josh](https://github.com/j127) and [Dan](https://github.com/philomathdan/Nand2Tetris)
